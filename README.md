# 01 HTML CSS Git: Code Refactor

## Description 

This repository contains the refactored code for Horiseon Social Solution Services website so that there are now accessible features for people with disabilities. People with disabilities can now access Horiseon's website using assistive technologies such as video captions, screen readers, and braille keyboards. In search engines, such as Google, the website will now be better positioned and optimized due to this added feature. 

Previously, there were also some imperfections within the code, so I have changed and improved the codebase and functionality of the website. The links within the navigation bar were not functioning, but now they will take the user to the designated spot within the website. When viewing the source code, you will now find that semantic HTML elements are being used and are positioned in a logical order. A title to the page has also been added so that it reads "Horiseon Social Solution Services". Overall, this code is now more efficient and the website will be more sustainable in the long-term.

# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

## Your Task

This week’s homework requires you to create an application that an employee can use to generate a random password based on criteria they’ve selected by modifying starter code. This app will run in the browser, and will feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by JavaScript code that you write. It will have a clean and polished user interface that is responsive, ensuring that it adapts to multiple screen sizes.

The password can include special characters. If you’re unfamiliar with these, see this [list of Password Special Characters from the OWASP Foundation](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Password_special_characters).

## User Story
